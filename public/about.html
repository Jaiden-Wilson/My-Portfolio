        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello friends! At heart, I am a passionate learner with a hunger to succeed in whatever I do. I started my post-secondary education in Chemical Engineering at a top canadian university, but was forced to discontinue during a mental health crisis. I was introduced to programming in high school where I learned introductory Java. Then, when COVID hit, I asked myself:"What can I do with the knowledge in programming I have now in order to earn money"? I took up game development in Java and later experimented in project building with Unity. Game development is still something I am interested in pursuing within my career. While in my first year of university, I landed a co-op as a junior web developer for a company called Aftersell. This is where I got my feet wet with front-end web development. What interests me most about front-end is using frameworks such as React.js to create beautiful, modern, and responsive designs efficiently. Check out my <a href="../../Capstone Project 1/index.html">resume</a> here to learn more about me and my skills! </p>
